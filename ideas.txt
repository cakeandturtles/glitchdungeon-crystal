environments & things:

-shapeshifting memory:
    -glitch/player that moves around the room randomly and repeats words/phrases that the user has seen before
        -(each text that the user sees is checked and added to a GameData.TextSet object that is saved and selected from)
        -this creature will randomly shapeshift to different npc/player/creature tilesets
        -follows behind the player, but when you talk to it it will jump and move around/away?
