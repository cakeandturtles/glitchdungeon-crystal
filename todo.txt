0. Implement a "save" sort of thing, that will save the player's place and "collected" abilities and current glitch?
    A. SAVE GAME: (things to save)
        ****EASIEST THING TO DO:: give every object a save function        
            ***every time a "save" is done, call an export/import and store as 'current game' or something
            ***on top of the export, call the "SAVE" function
        
        1) Last recorded checkpoint (revive at that checkpoint)
        2) All collected inventory (give the player an inventory to manage things instead of holding glitches in the level manager??)
        3) states of collectables (collected or not)
    B. SAVE STATE: (things to save)
        0) ***everything specified above PLUS***
        1) current player spot
        2) 
1. start designing "scenarios"
